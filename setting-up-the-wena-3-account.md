# Sony account troubles.
**I don't recommend attempting to create a wena account via the Sony Account method in the wena 3 app.** You would be better off using your (or setting up an) Apple ID and using that for authentication. The documentation below serves only as a record of my issues.

The process starts as usual at a login screen where you can choose an authentication method.

Tapping "Sign in with Sony Account" presents you with an opportunity to enter your Sony account User Name.

I have a Sony account, have had for some time (I am a former employee) and attempted to use that account, but the password wasn't accepted. I even went through the process of having a reset link emailed to me but it never showed up. Here's what that looks like.

The process of signing up for a new account is fairly standard. I won't belabor the process but I'll put screenshots below so you don't have to go to the trouble of translating.

Tap create new account.

Enter a password.

Set some info

Agree to terms you probably can't read. :D

And finally, get an error.

If you need to cancel at any time, this is the screen you'll see.
