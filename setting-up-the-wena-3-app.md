# Setting up the wena 3 app
Launching the wena 3 app will present you with the following screen (translation to the right)
![wena 3 app Startup Screen](https://github.com/TheRiflesSpiral/Sony-wena-3/blob/main/Images/sonywena3appstartup.png)

There are no options to be set here. The only available "area" is Japan and if you're setting up a different watch (the wena wrist or wrist pro/active) you're using the wrong app. The only thing to do here is tap "connect with this model."

The next screen asks you to charge the device.
