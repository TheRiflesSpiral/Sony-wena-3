# Setting up the wena 3 app
Launching the wena 3 app will present you with the following screen (translation to the right)

![wena 3 app Startup Screen](https://github.com/TheRiflesSpiral/Sony-wena-3/blob/main/Images/sonywena3appstartup.png)

There are no options to be set here. The only available "area" is Japan and if you're setting up a different watch (the wena wrist or wrist pro/active) you're using the wrong app. The only thing to do here is tap "connect with this model."

The next screen asks you to charge the device.

The next screen asks you to turn on your device.

And that's where I'll have to leave it for now. I haven't received my wena 3 from Japan yet, so stay tuned!
