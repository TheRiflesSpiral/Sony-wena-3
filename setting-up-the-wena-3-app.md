# Setting up the wena 3 app
The first time you launch the app it will ask for a number of permissions. There's no sense in denying any of them at this point; you can always deny access in Settings leter.

Next the app will present you with the following screen (translation to the right)

![wena 3 app Startup Screen](https://github.com/TheRiflesSpiral/Sony-wena-3/blob/main/Images/sonywena3appstartup.png)

There are no options to be set here. The only available "area" is Japan and if you're setting up a different watch (the wena wrist or wrist pro/active) you're using the wrong app. The only thing to do here is tap "connect with this model."

Tapping the button will bring you to a login screen. Encouragingly, it appears in English and asks you to sign in with a Sony account or an Apple account. (Facebook login was removed recently so you won't find that here... you really shouldn't be using that anyway)

I made the mistake of thinking I could use my Sony account to log in but apparently a Sony account in Japan means something different from a Sony account in the U.S. Tapping "Sign in with Sony account" presents you with this scren where you _could_ create a Sony account.



I tried this a few times, providing an email and password but each time, the process ended with an error. I suspect it has something to do with Regions, as this only fails after providing an email and presumably Sony is checking with Google, preventing non-JP region users from creating an account.

My solution was to choose "Sign in with Apple" and providing my Apple ID credentials. This worked perfectly and after logging in, the wena account creation process continues, asking for a few more details and then connects itself to your Apple ID details, allowing you to log in using your Apple ID from that point on.

The next screen asks you to charge the device.

The next screen asks you to turn on your device.

And that's where I'll have to leave it for now. I haven't received my wena 3 from Japan yet, so stay tuned!
