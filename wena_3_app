# Sony wena 3 app (Android)
The wena 3 smartwatch band is connected to an app called "wena 3" available on the Google Play Store. If you're in Japan. Searching for the app from North America will either return a not-so-helpful "This application is not available in your region" message or, even less helpfully, simply refuse to return any search results.

My initial thought was to simply load the Play Store while connected through a VPN server in Tokyo, tricking Google Services into thinking I was "in the region." However, the search behavior did not change. Googling "how to change region in Play Store" led me to a document at Google that explained you can only change your region once per year and that there are some fairly serious consequences to your google account when changing regions. So that was out.

On Android, an app is essentially a single application file called an APK. (Application package) You can install an app by simply getting your hands on the APK and opening it within the Android system. (This is called "sideloading" an app). In some cases, larger apps are broken into multiple APK's and are bundled in various ways. These bundles cannot simply be opened the same way an APK is and the wena 3 app is of this type. The best solution these days is to install an application manager app that can handle searching, downloading and sideloading of applications. There are many apps available for this but the most reliable in my experience is APKPURE.

I was able to get the wena 3 app installed on my device by following the procedure below.
1. On your device, use a browser and visit https://apkpure.com
2. Download the apkpure app to your device and open it. (you may have to change some settings to allow "unknown" applications to be installed.
3. Open the apkpure app and search for wena 3.
4. Download and install the app.

Once the app was installed I was able to run it but of course it's in Japanese so I needed a translator to make heads or tails of it.

### Google Lens
Google lens is an Android (and iOS, I think) app that will translate from your camera or from images in your photo library. It easily and naturally translates Japanese to English.
