How to obtain, setup and use a Sony wena 3 Smart watch band in North America
In this repository, I will keep all information gathered in my effort to use the Sony wena 3 smartwatch band in the U.S.A.
## What is a Sony wena 3?

The Sony wena 3 is the third iteration of Sony Electronic's "smartwatch band" product. (Preceded by the wena wrist and wena wrist pro/wena active) Wena is a portamanteau of <i>W</i>ear <i>E</i>lectronics <i>Na</i>turally. It is essentially a limited-function smartwatch in the shape of a folding clasp found on traditional metal watch bands. It integrates a number of features including bluetooth, allowing it to connect to an iOS or Android device via the wena or wena 3 apps.

The wena 3 product is available only in Japan and is intended for the Japanese market only. The device's display can be switched to English, however, making it useable for non-Japanese speakers. The wena 3 app, however is only (mostly) Japanese so I'll do my best to post the various screens and their translations as I encounter them.

## But why?
I've worn a watch as long as I've been able to tell time. Over the years I've honed my tastes and I'm currently down to what us horologophiles call a "three-watch collection." My every-day watch is a Marathon Arctic GSAR, the 41mm model.

I've also tinkered with normal smartwatches a bit. I did wear the original Fitbit Charge for some time when it was new and also wore a ZTE Quartz for a short time. I came to enjoy the connection to my smartphone and the ability to get notifications on my wrist but I missed the ability to simply raise a watch to my gaze to tell the time and found the constant charging tedius. I found the Fossil HR line a few years ago and enjoyed wearing it but its connection to my phone was flaky at best, the watch's firmware was buggy and laggy and the phone app is practically unusable. It's seriously awuful. Really bad.

The obvious choice would be one of the dozens of excellent WearOS watches (being an Android user) or an Apple Watch (also being an Apple fan) but I came to the conclusion that my enjoyment of a watch doesn't have much to do with it's features. I like mechanical watches because of their utility, craftsmanship and ease of use. The wena 3 appeals to me because I can wear a mechanical watch and still get the limited smartwatch features I want. I hope. We'll see, I guess.

### Challenges
Most of the challenges I've encountered thus far are due to the wena 3 being intended for the Japanese market. As I encounter and overcome them, I'll add details below.

#### 1. wena 3 App
The first obstacle was installing the wena 3 app. Details about installing the app can be found on the details page here: https://github.com/TheRiflesSpiral/Sony-wena-3/blob/main/wena_3_app
